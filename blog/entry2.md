# The Ghost Planet

**Date:** Stardate 45301.8  
**Location:** Surface of Gliese-581d  

The landscape is barren yet eerily beautiful. Jagged obsidian spires claw at a sickly green sky, illuminated by the distant red dwarf sun. The air is unbreathable, thick with carbon dioxide and traces of ammonia—yet the readings suggest something once lived here.

I found remnants of structures, half-buried in the ashen soil. They are not natural formations. Scorched symbols adorn their surfaces, a language lost to entropy. The silence here is deafening, as though the planet itself mourns its forgotten inhabitants.

I scan for biological traces. Nothing. If life was ever here, it has long since vanished. Was this world once a cradle of civilization? What happened to them? A war? A slow, creeping extinction? Or did they, like me, stare into the abyss and decide to leave?

I collect my samples and take one last look before boarding my ship. A ghost planet—haunted by the echoes of a people I will never know.
