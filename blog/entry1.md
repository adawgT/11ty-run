# Echoes in the Void

**Date:** Stardate 45289.3  
**Location:** Uncharted Nebula, 56 light-years from Earth  

Drifting alone through the cosmic abyss, I find solace in the hum of the ship’s life support. The nebula around me glows with a soft, bioluminescent blue, swirling like a painter’s dream. The isolation is profound—only the whispers of past transmissions and the rhythmic beeping of my vessel accompany me.

Today, I encountered something peculiar: an unidentified signal, pulsing at intervals that suggest intelligence. It lacks the chaotic randomness of a natural phenomenon. I ran it through every decryption algorithm I possess, but nothing matches known extraterrestrial patterns. Could it be the first proof that we are not alone? Or is it a mere echo of a forgotten civilization, lost to time?

I send a reply in the universal language of mathematics, a beacon into the dark. Will something—someone—answer?
